         "At Massey's, we prioritize safety in all aspects of our operations. Our leadership 
sets the standard by following the same safety rules we expect workers to adhere to.
Workers are empowered to request the suspension or shutdown of any work activity they believe to be unsaf, 
and our safety manager and project management team regularly inspects job sites to identify potential hazards. 
Thorough investigations are conducted to pinpoint underlying hazards, their causes, and any deficiencies in 
our safety and health program. We actively involve our workforce in hazard prevention and control 
efforts while evaluating the effectiveness of existing safety controls and explore new technologies that 
may offer better protection. Ensuring that workers possess the knowledge and skills needed to perform their 
jobs safely is a top priority at Massey's, conducting regular toolbox talks focused on pertinent safety issues faced 
by our workers. Our safety committee remains dedicated to analyzing safety 
performance in the field and refining safety procedures. We are a member and certification holder of the North 
American Contractors Certification (NACC) for glass and metal contractors, subjecting our safety program to 
annual audits that provide valuable feedback and recommendations."
